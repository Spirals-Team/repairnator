# Documentation of Repairnator

This directory provides the official documentation about the Repairnator project.

## Overview

Repairnator is a bot to automatically repair failing continuous integration builds. By repairing we mean synthesizing and proposing patches to the developer.

Repairnator can be used:

* [as a Jenkins plugin](https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/blob/master/doc/repairnator-jenkins-plugin.md)
* [as a Github app](https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/blob/master/doc/repairnator-github-app.md)
* as a command line tool, see "Command line" below
* as a Travis CI scanner, see "Travis Scanner" below

## Contributing

Contributions to Repairnator are more than welcome!
A first way to contribute is to look at the label [good-first-issue](https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/labels/good-first-issue).

## Running Repairnator

### Command line

To fix a specific Travis CI build:

```
docker run -e BUILD_ID=564711868 -e GITHUB_OAUTH=<GITHUB TOKEN> repairnator/pipeline
```

It is possible to create your own GitHub token from [this page](https://github.com/settings/tokens), by selecting `public_repo` referring to the scope that has to be associated with the token.

You can also specify the values associated with these parameters: [REPAIR_TOOLS](https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/blob/a78745d1f6c0cf4d356cfc20485030fc0f18eb79/doc/repairnator-config.md#repair_tools), [MONGODB_HOST](https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/blob/a78745d1f6c0cf4d356cfc20485030fc0f18eb79/doc/repairnator-config.md#mongodb_host), [MONGODB_NAME](https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/blob/a78745d1f6c0cf4d356cfc20485030fc0f18eb79/doc/repairnator-config.md#mongodb_name), [PUSH_URL](https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/blob/a78745d1f6c0cf4d356cfc20485030fc0f18eb79/doc/repairnator-config.md#push_url), [SMTP_SERVER](https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/blob/a78745d1f6c0cf4d356cfc20485030fc0f18eb79/doc/repairnator-config.md#smtp_server), [NOTIFY_TO](https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/blob/a78745d1f6c0cf4d356cfc20485030fc0f18eb79/doc/repairnator-config.md#notify_to), [GITHUB_USERNAME](https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/blob/a78745d1f6c0cf4d356cfc20485030fc0f18eb79/doc/repairnator-config.md#github_username), [GITHUB_USEREMAIL](https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/blob/a78745d1f6c0cf4d356cfc20485030fc0f18eb79/doc/repairnator-config.md#github_useremail), and [CREATE_PR](https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/blob/a78745d1f6c0cf4d356cfc20485030fc0f18eb79/doc/repairnator-config.md#create_pr). Before every parameter name, it is necessary to put the key `-e`, as in the above example.

### Travis Scanner

The scanner continuously pulls new build identifiers from Travis CI.

Prerequisites: Java, Docker

```
git clone https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/
cd repairnator/src/scripts/
# doc at https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/blob/master/doc/scripts.md#launch_rtscannersh
bash launch_rtscanner.sh
```

## Program repair tools used in Repairnator
 
For more information about the program repair tools and their strategies implemented in Repairnator, [take a look at this page](repair-tools.md).

To add a new program repair tool in Repairnator, [here is the guide](contributing/add-repair-tool.md).

## Architecture

### The pipeline

The pipeline takes as input a Travis CI build ID and tries to replicate the bug and to repair it with different repair tools. It provides a single abstraction over repair tools. As its name indicates, it's a pipeline of steps, from cloning the repository and building it, to launching the repair tools and pushing a resulting branch. It contains plenty of options, for notifying the users, creating a pull requests, etc.

The pipeline be used:
* directly in Java
* or as a Docker image: it encapsulates the pipeline in an environment in which it will properly work, with the right dependencies, in a sandboxed environment.

### The scanner

The `RTScanner` is a daemon that constantly inspects Travis CI for catching newly failing builds to launch as fast as possible. When failing builds are found, a pipeline is run per build. `FastScanner` is a different implementation of the same idea.

[Deployment in Kubernetes](https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/blob/master/doc/repairnator-kubernetes.md)

### Java main classes

This [page](main-classes.md) documents the main classes of Repairnator.

### Chores

As part of using Repairnator, you might need to do some chores, like managing a MongoDB database.
We provided some documentation [about backups](chore/managedb.md) and [about MongoDB collection schema](chore/mongo).

### Scripts

The documentation about the scripts is [available here](scripts.md). More details about the Repairnator configuration file can be found [here](repairnator-config.md).


### Pull-requests

When Repairnator is configured to create a pull-request automatically, it uses the text of `TEXT_PR` from [AbstractRepairStep](https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/blob/master/src/repairnator-pipeline/src/main/java/fr/inria/spirals/repairnator/process/step/repair/AbstractRepairStep.java). In the future, it is planned to generate a specific piece of text to explain the patch (see [Explainable Software Bot Contributions: Case Study of Automated Bug Fixes](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02597) ([doi:10.1109/BotSE.2019.00010](https://doi.org/10.1109/BotSE.2019.00010)))


## Content of the repository

This repository is organized as follows:

  * [doc](../doc) contains the reference documentation about Repairnator and its usage;
  * [repairnator](../repairnator) is the main program dedicated to this project: it can automatically scan large set of projects, detect failing builds, reproduce them and try to repair them using our tools;
  * [resources](../resources) contains mainly data produced by Repairnator, scripts to retrieve those data, and it also contains the schema of repairnator.json files;
  * [website](../website) contains all data to produce repairnator website.
