* Note: When using repairnator together with GitHub PR builder, the advanced option can be left empty as the repairnator plugin will guess the Git URL and branch from the SCM information in the freestyle job. 


### Advanced

If you don't use a Github build or a pull-request build, you must specify the Git Url and Git branch by expanding the `advanced` menu.

## Architecture Overview (for plugin developers)

The general workflow of the plugin itself is like this, html page (from `.jelly` code) -> plugin get values from form fields -> Error check , if nothing wrong create a `RunPipelineAction` class to run the pipeline with `JenkinsLauncher` class as a special entry point for repairnator when using in Jenkins context.  


Repairnator Jenkins plugin imports the `repairnator-pipeline` code as a maven dependency, so most of the features of the pipeline can be reused without any big change.
