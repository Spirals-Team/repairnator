# Repairnator GitHub App

The Repairnator GitHub App provides support to automatically run the Repairnator pipeline on each failing build:

1. Detect failing builds
2. Search for a patch
3. If a valid patch is found, create a pull-request on Github

It does so by pushing failing travisCI build identifiers to an ActiveMQ server. A worker pulls them for the repair attemtps.

## How to Install the Repairnator GitHub App?

1. visit https://github.com/apps/repairnator-bot
2. click on the green button "Install"


__Permissions__ In order to listen on specific events with this app, it is required to enable permissions of `Issues`, `Pull requests` and `Commit statuses`, to `Read & Write` for all of them.

__Webhook URL__ It is using webhook payload delivery service from https://smee.io, learn more [here](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#manually-configuring-a-github-app). Some alternatives are listed [here](https://probot.github.io/docs/deployment/#deploy-the-app). The webhook  URL is required at `Settings > Developer > settings > GitHub Apps > repairnator-bot`.

__`.env` file__ This GitHub app requires `.env` file. The detailed introducation is [here](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#manually-configuring-a-github-app). Two pieces of information need to be filled: 
* one TRAVIS API Token
* the Webhook Secret field from `Settings > Developer > settings > GitHub Apps > repairnator-bot` .


## How to Use the Repairnator GitHub App?

1. trigger a Travis CI build: for example create a PR, reopen a PR, make commits inside a PR
2. if the travis CI build is __failing__ and the language setting in `.travis.yml` is __java__, then a comment will be posted to the pull request
3. for this failing build, if Repairnator can find one valid patch, it will create one PR for the current PR

## Architecture Overview (for developers)

The server listens to several GitHub webhooks, and execute corresponding scripts based on the events. The most important script is to request travisCI's Build info via Travis API. For each failing java-language build, the server will push its buildId to Repairnator's ActiveMQ. Repairnator-pipeline will pick up each buildId and invoke repair tools to generate possible patches. If valid patches are found, then corresponding pull-requests will be created on GitHub.

### Run Server on your own

```sh
cd  repairnator/repairnator-github-app/

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```
