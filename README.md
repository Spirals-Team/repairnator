# Repairnator: an open-source platform for automatic program repair

Repairnator is a nice open-source project and community hosted at the [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) open-source foundation.

The goal of Repairnator is to be the reference open-source platform for [automated repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_bug_fixing). All kinds of repair are considered: test failure repair, compilation error repair, static warning repair, etc.

Eclipse/repairnator is a welcoming community :-)

You're welcome to join the community with an existing piece of repair software, to be integrated and pushed in the repository.

You're welcome to join the community with a novel project to be hosted in the repository.

You're welcome to join the community just to help, we have a number of [open issues](https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/) on which new contributors can jump in.

Repairnator is done by a [a nice team](https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/issues/760) of welcoming engineers and researchers. Say [hello](https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/issues/798) or create an issue!
