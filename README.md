# Repairnator: a program repair bot for continuous integration

Repairnator is a software development bot that automatically repairs build failures on continuous integration.
It monitors failing Travis CI builds in Java projects, tries to locally reproduce the failing builds and finally attempts to repair them with the state-of-the-art of [automated program repair research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_bug_fixing). Repairnator is a community effort, driven by Martin Monperrus at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
