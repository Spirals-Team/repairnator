# Repairnator: an open-source platform for automatic program repair

Repairnator is an open-source project for [automated program repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_bug_fixing). All kinds of repair are considered: test failure repair, compilation error repair, static warning repair, crash repair, etc. Repairnator is integrated with continuous integration (Travis CI, Jenkins, etc.) and makes pull-requests with fixes. The project is hosted at the [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) open-source foundation.

Eclipse/repairnator is a welcoming community :-) You're welcome to join the community with an existing piece of repair software, to be integrated and pushed in the repository. You're welcome to join the community with a novel project to be hosted in the repository. You're welcome to contribute, we have a number of [open issues](https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator/issues) on which new contributors can jump in.
