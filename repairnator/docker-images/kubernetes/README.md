# Deploy a high avaliable Repairnator in Kubernetes

*On going pull request*

In order to make Repairnator highly available, it might be good to have configurations and tools to deploy Repairnator in Kubernetes, a preliminary idea here:

- A queue system like ActiveMQ to save build ids
- A K8s cron job running repairnator scaner to get latest build ids and add them into the queue
- A set of pods running repairnator pipeline which fetches build id from the queue and does the analysis

# How to set up repairnator on K8s

![Design](K8sRepairnatorDesign.jpg)


## Setup mongodb and ActiveMQ
First set up mongodb on kubernetes with a persistent memory volume(PVC)(This mean that even if you erase the deployment and redeploy nothing will be lost, the database would look the same)

Then create the mongodb deployemnt using mongodb.yaml in the k8s-mongodb folder .

* kubectl create -f k8s-mongodb/mongodb.yaml

Try it out
* kubectl get pods 
Our mongodb pod should be named like "mongo-controller-XXXXX" then we can get into the pod 
* kubectl exec -it mongo-controller-XXXXX bash
* mongo

Now deploy ActiveMQ for effective queue managements of jobs to the pipeline and scanner. First apply the yaml file inside the queue-for-buildids folder
* kubectl create -f /queue-for-buildids/activemq.yaml
To access to the web interface
* kubectl get pods 
It should look like activemq-XXXXXXX-XXXXX. Then 
* kubectl exec -it activemq-XXXXXXX-XXXXX bash
To expose to localhost for webinterface access and also publishing(sending message to queue) outside the cluster. 
* kubectl port-forward activemq-XXXXXXX-XXXXX 8161:8161 61613:61613
Access webinterface with "http://localhost:8161/admin/" in your browser. The default username is "admin" and password is also "admin".

To send message to queue use the publisher.py script in queue-for-buildids folder. Syntax
* python publisher.py -d queue-name message-1 message-2 message3 ... message-N

queue-name is according to the format /queue/name. For instance /queue/scanner will send message to the scanner queue.
You can use this later to manually input build id to the pipeline queue or project to the scanner queue

## Setup scanners and pipelines

To deploy the scanner first go into folder "scanner-dockerimage" then directly build and push the image to docker hub(enviroment variables can be specified or changed later in the "repairnator-scanner.yaml" file. With docker 
* docker build -t repairnator-scanner:tagname .
* docker tag repairnator-scanner:tagname YOUR_DOCKERHUB_NAME/repairnator-scanner
* docker push YOUR_DOCKERHUB_NAME/repairnator-scanner:tagname
Then go to "repairnator-deployment-yamlfiles" folder. Open repairnator-scanner.yaml then replace the image 

```
...
	containers:
      - name: repairnator-scanner
        image: YOUR_DOCKERHUB_NAME/repairnator-scanner:tagname
...
```

Now create the scanner with 
* kubectl create -f repairnator-scanner.yaml
Then go to "http://localhost:8161/admin/queues.jsp" and you should see a scanner queue with one consumer.

Same goes for the pipeline, first go to "pipeline-dockerimage docker build and push it and modify the yaml file then fill in env values in the "repairnator-pipeline.yaml" file , then create with kubectl and you should also see on the same page a pipeline queue with one consumer.

## Example run
In the folder "queue-for-buildids" use publisher.py to send messages to the queue. If you have a slug (like "surli/failingProject") you can send it to the scanner queue for scanning. The scanner will auto submit the interesting BuildIds to the pipeline queue for generating patches. So sending by
* python publisher.py /queue/scanner surli/failingProject
This will give some patches to the pipeline and you can confirm that by checking at the webpage for message enqueued. Then you can also see that in the pipeline pod. 
* kubectl get pods
You should see something like repairnator-scanner-XXXXXXXXX-XXXXX . Watch the output of the scanner by(in realtime with flag -f)
* kubectl logs repairnator-scanner-XXXXXXXXX-XXXXX
Also for the pipeline if there are some interesting build gotten from the scanner you will be able to see it with 
* kubectl logs repairnator-pipeline-XXXXXXXXX-XXXXX
The output of the pipeline such as patches, hardwareinfo .. is submitted to the cloud mongodb just like the non-cloud repairnator.

To scale this either you can change the "replicas" value in the yaml file and reapply the yaml or scale it with kubectl
* kubectl scale --replicas=3 -f repairnator-pipeline.yaml
This will create 2 more pipelines and you should be able to see it "http://localhost:8161/admin/queues.jsp" . Same thing with the scanner if you need more than one like for instance if there are too many jobs in the queue.

## Setup repo monitor
The idea with this monitor is that it first check any incoming github webhook if it's authorized to be scanned or not before sending a message to the scanner queue to scan the repo mentioned in the github-payload. To security-check incomming message it will fetch credentials information stored in the database mongodb deployed previously , then it doublechecks it will the accompied hash SHA1 also in the incomming webhook payload. This means that the one sended need to be registered in MongoDB to be able to use this feature. An example to add a register a user is first go to the database by 
* kubectl get pods
* kubectl exec -it activemq-XXXXXXX-XXXXX bash
* mongo
Then we need to create a database called "githook" (note that it must be named like this according to the script if you don't plan to change it) and insert some information into a collection called "gitSecrets". These are done by these steps below.
* use githook
* db.gitSecrets.insert({{"slugName" : "Spirals-Team/repairnator", "gitSecret" : "123456789"}})

Next is deploying the repo monitor itself on K8s. First you need to go to the "repomonitor-dockerimage" to build and push an image to docker just like how we did with the scanner. Then there is also a yaml file in "repairnator-deployment-yamlfiles" folder for deploying and also here we need to replace in the "repo-monitor.yaml" file the name of your image you tagged before when pushing to docker (format DOCKER_USER_NAME/IMAGE_NAME). Then apply the yaml 
* kubectl create -f repo-monitor.yaml

This will create a pod named "repo-monitor-XXXXXXXX-XXXX" together with a service creating a Loadbalancer with an external address for github. We need to fetch this address by this command 
* kubectl get svc 
and look for a service named "repo-monitor" then take its external IP (it usually takes a while before the LoadBalancer finish setting up).
Then go to your repo github page -> setting -> webhook -> add new webhook and then add the Payload URL" as "http://LoadBalancer_IP/" shown in the picture below, "Content type" is set as "application/json" then secret is the "gitSecret" previously added to the database "123456789" (Note: this should be a hash of some kind like a MD5 hash to be safer) then also select "Let me select individual events" to scroll down a bit to select "Statuses". The reason we choose only sending status update is because the server is set to only activate the pipeline when the build status is failure.
![repo-monitor-picture](repo-monitor-example.png)

Now back to the terminal. We can check the logs of our repo-monitor deployed earlier by first 
* kubectl logs -f repo-monitor-XXXXXXXX-XXXX

You should be able to see something like
```
Listening on port 30050!
Authorized
Sending scan request for slug Spirals-Team/repairnator
```
Same logic apply for any repo want to be monitored. First register the slug in database with a secret then add a webhook like mentioned before then we are done. 

## Delete deployment
Provided with every yaml files mentioned in this readme (all of them are in "repairnator-deployment-yamlfile" folder), call 
* kubectl delete -f "yamlfile" 
To remove each of them. For instance kubectl delete -f repairnator-scanner.yaml to remove the scanners.
